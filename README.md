# VecTur: Vector Turning Machines

This is a repo for research in progress on an architecture called VecTur,
short for Vector Turing Machine. It is designed to have the following advantages

* As expressive as a general Turing Machine (technically, a finite state machine with a large number of states).
* Can be used as a block in a Llama macro or other modern LLM architecture.
* Suitable for mechanistic interpretability.
